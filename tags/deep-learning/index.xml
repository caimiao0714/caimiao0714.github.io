      <description>Chapter 1 Introduction Why GPU is powerful for deep learning? Graphics Processing units (GPUs), also known as graphics card, is a special kind of processor in your computer that can handle thousands of single tasks at the same time, especially designed for displaying 3D environments on a computer for playing games. These same basic tasks are very similar to what neural networks do, such that GPUs can run neural networks hundreds of times faster than regular GPUs.</description>
